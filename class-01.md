  <h1> What is HTML & Javascript?</h1>

<p> In the beginning of the book by the publisher Jon Duckett, it starts off with the reader trying to grasp with what HTML is. Of ourse, my impression is that it's for the person who has never used coding system to structure their HTML. It's giving them an idea of the basics of how the HTML works. After the reader gains more information of this coding works, they will learn how to comment, attribute, use inline elements, etc. to enhance there learning experience with HTML. Afterwards, they will dive into how to use HTML 5 and dive into the design of HTML. </p> 

<p> With the HTML & CSS being summarized, Javascript is given to the reader with what goal would they need to accomplish when creating a code for it to function. They give real world ideas of what it means to use a Javascript. When using this type of coding system, it requires you to use some codes that aren't as similar as HTML & CSS. They require a lot of functionality and commands for a website to be completed. There is more coding out there and this is just the beginning!  </p>
